#Color Thief PHP

A PHP class for grabbing the color palette from an image. Uses PHP and GD library to make it happen.

It's a PHP port of the [Color Thief Javascript library] (http://github.com/lokesh/color-thief), using the MMCQ (modified median cut quantization) algorithm from the [Leptonica library] (http://www.leptonica.com/).

##How to use

###Get the dominant color from an image
```php
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
use ColorThief\ColorThief;
$dominantColor = ColorThief::getColor($sourceImage);
```
The `$sourceImage` variable must contain either the path (relative or absolute) of the image on the server, or a URL to the image.

```php
ColorThief::getColor($sourceImage[, $quality=10]) 
returns array(r: num, g: num, b: num)
```

This function returns an array of three integer values, corresponding to the RGB values (Red, Green & Blue) of the dominant color. 

You can pass an additional argument (`$quality`) to adjust the calculation accuracy of the dominant color. 1 is the highest quality settings, 10 is the default. But be aware that there is a trade-off between quality and speed/memory consumption !
If the quality settings are too high (close to 1) relative to the image size (pixel counts), it may **exceed the memory limit** set in the PHP configuration (and computation will be slow).


###Build a color palette from an image

In this example, we build an 8 color palette.

```php
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
use ColorThief\ColorThief;
$palette = ColorThief::getPalette($sourceImage, 8)
```

Again, the `$sourceImage` variable must contain either the path (relative or absolute) of the image on the server, or a URL to the image.

```php
ColorThief::getPalette($sourceImage[, $colorCount=10, $quality=10])
returns array(array(num, num, num), array(num, num, num), ... )
```

The `$colorCount` argument determines the size of the palette; the number of colors returned. If not set, it defaults to 10.

The `$quality` argument works as in the previous function.
